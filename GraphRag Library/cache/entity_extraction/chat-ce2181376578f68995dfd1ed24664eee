White Whale\u2014no.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, then; good bye now, and I\u2019ll call again in a minute.\u201d\n\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\nover the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\nhands into a trumpet and shouted\u2014\u201cNo, Sir! No!\u201d Upon which Ahab\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\nchains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\nbag.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your nose, there?\u201d said Stubb. \u201cBroke it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish it was broken, or that I didn\u2019t have any nose at all!\u201d answered\nthe Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\nmuch. \u201cBut what are you holding _yours_ for?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, nothing! It\u2019s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain\u2019t\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\nye, Bouton-de-Rose?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the devil\u2019s name do you want here?\u201d roared the Guernseyman,\nflying into a sudden passion.\n\n\u201cOh! keep cool\u2014cool? yes, that\u2019s the word! why don\u2019t you pack those\nwhales in ice while you\u2019re working at \u2019em? But joking aside, though; do\nyou know, Rose-bud, that it\u2019s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\nsuch whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn\u2019t a gill in his\nwhole carcase.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that well enough; but, d\u2019ye see, the Captain here won\u2019t believe\nit; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\ncome aboard, and mayhap he\u2019ll believe you, if he won\u2019t me; and so I\u2019ll\nget out of this dirty scrape.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\u201d rejoined Stubb,\nand with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\nconstantly filled their olfactories.\n\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\nthe Captain\u2019s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\nfiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\nwithin. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\nto the Captain\u2019s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.\n\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\nhad brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter\u2019s office,\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\nin him during the interview.\n\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\nlarge whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\nvest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\npolitely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\non the aspect of interpreting between them.\n\n\u201cWhat shall I say to him first?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \u201cyou\nmay as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\nthough I don\u2019t pretend to be a judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur,\u201d said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\ncaptain, \u201cthat only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\nand chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\nblasted whale they had brought alongside.\u201d\n\nUpon this the captain started, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
